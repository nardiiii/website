      <h3>Playing guitar & singing</h3>
      <p>I really loved singing eversince I was a little girl.I admired many singers too and wanted to be like them in the future.As for the guitar, I started playing the guitar when I was 13 b/c it was my favorite thing to do.And now I would also love to play the piano.</p>

      <h3>Playing tennis</h3>
      <p> alt=""I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old. But unfortunately I stopped playing tennis for some reasons.That aside I would definitely love to play tennis again.Tennis helps you deal with physical, mental, social and emotional challenges, which increases your capacity to deal with stress.So I recommend you try it too.</p>
